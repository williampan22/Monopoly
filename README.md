# Monopoly - Quarter 4 Project

## Description

We recreated the Monopoly game owned by Hasbro in Java. The game consists of players rolling dice to move around the board, buying properties, collecting money, drawing cards, and winning by being the last alive. When players have no more money (negative money) and owe money to the bank or other players, they must sell or morgtage their properties to achieve enough money to pay their debts back. When players have no more money, they lose and are out of the game. 

The Monopoly board consists of 40 properties, with the corners being GO (the starting position), Visting Jail / Jail, Free Parking, and Go TO JAIL. Passing GO gives the player $200, while being in Jail makes the player not able to move for 3 moves. 

The player moves by rolling two dice every turn, labeled from one to six. The sum of the dice (ranging from 2-12) is the distance the player moves from its current position. 

Chance and Community Chests are positions in the board which cannot be owned. When the player lands on a Chance or Community Card, the player draws a card which either grants them the following: 

1) Gain $200
2) Lose $200 
3) GO TO JAIL

If the player lands on a property that is not yet owned, they can purcahese the property for a certain amount of money shown in the UI Interface to the right. If a player lands on a property that they own, nothing happens. If a player lands on a property owned by another property, they have pay that player a certain amount of money based on the following rules: 

1) If the property is a railroad the pay due depends on the amount owned by the player: 1 = $50, 2 = $100, 3 = $150, 4 = $200
2) If the property is a utility the pay depends on the amount of utiltiies owned by the player: 1 = twice the dice rolled, 2 = four times the dice rolled
3) Otherwise, the amount of pay is specific to the property owned
